InVEST 3.2.0 is a major release with the addition of several experimental models and tools as well as an upgrade to the PyGeoprocessing core:

* Upgrade to PyGeoprocessing v0.3.0a1 for miscelaneous performance improvements to InVEST's core geoprocessing routines.
* An alpha unstable build of the InVEST crop production model is released with partial documentation and sample data.
* A beta build of the InVEST fisheries model is released with documentation and sample data.
* An alpha unstable build of the nutrient delivery ratio (NDR) model is available directly under InVEST's instalation directory at  invest-x86/invest_ndr.exe; eventually this model will replace InVEST's current "Nutrient" model.  It is currently undocumented and unsupported but inputs are similar to that of InVEST's SDR model.
* An alpha unstable build of InVEST's implementation of GLOBIO is available directly under InVEST's instalation directory at  invest-x86/invest_globio.  It is currently undocumented but sample data are provided.
* DelinateIT, a watershed delination tool based on PyGeoprocessing's d-infinity flow algorithm is released as a standalone tool in the InVEST repository with documentation and sample data.
* Miscelaneous performance patches and bug fixes.
